Requirements 1.0

This project is going to perform computation on big numbers. The users who want to compute the addition and subtraction of big numbers with thousands of digits and cannot use ordinary calculators to get the result now can use this project to figure them out successfully just by entering two big numbers. And this project can not only compute addition and subtraction of big numbers, but also ordinary numbers, so it is very useful. And the version is V2.0

Details of the Computation: 
a.	big numbers with thousands of digits
b.	positive integer numbers
c.	two numbers
d.	support the numbers with same digits and different digits
e.	addition and subtraction
f.	If input numbers are not big numbers (less than 20 digits), output result correctly.
g.	If input numbers are both big numbers, output result correctly.
h.	If input one is big number and another one is not big number, output result correctly.
i.	If input contents are not numbers, then give a hint that just allow to input numbers and allow the users to input numbers again.
j.	If input numbers are more than two, then give a hint that just allow to input two numbers and allow the users to input numbers again.
k.	If input number are not integer, then give a hint that just allow to input the integer numbers and allow the users to input numbers again.


Requirements 2.0

Allow the input big numbers to have a decimal point. One number can have at most one decimal point. And the version is V2.0
1.	Allow to input big numbers with decimal point
2.	If input two big numbers that both with decimal point, output result correctly.
3.	If input one big number with decimal point and another one is integer big number, output result correctly.
